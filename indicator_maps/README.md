## Files for mapping between the indicators and the higher-level ontology concepts (from the unified ontology)

Format of the mapping files:
    [source] \t [source concept/indicator] \t [destination] \t [destination concept/indicator]

For each source concept/indicator, the top `k` alignments are given in descending order by confidence.  

Though there are several indicator ontologies, the `eidos` mapping files currently are referencing the `mitre12` (which combines several of the others) and the `who` (World Health Organization) ontologies.
