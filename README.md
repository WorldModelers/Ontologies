<sup>1</sup>This project is integrated with Travis so that each commit provokes unit tests to ensure that the ontology file(s) are in relatively good shape.

<sup>2</sup>It is furthermore connected to jitPack so that build tools like gradle, maven, sbt, or leiningen can retrieve their dependencies directly from GitHub.  Click on the jitPack icon for configuration instructions.

Documentation for the format of these files will soon appear here.
