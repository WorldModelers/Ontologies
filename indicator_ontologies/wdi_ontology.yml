    - The growth rate in the welfare aggregate of the total population is computed
      as the annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income
      of the total population in  the income distribution in a country from household
      surveys over a roughly 5-year period. Mean per capita real consumption or income
      is measured at 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) using the PovcalNet (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet).
      For some countries means are not reported due to grouped and/or confidential
      data. The annualized growth rate is computed as (Mean in final year/Mean in
      initial year)^(1/(Final year - Initial year)) - 1.  The reference year is the
      year in which the underlying household survey data was collected. In cases for
      which the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the first year
      in which data were collected is reported. The initial year refers to the nearest
      survey collected 5 years before the most recent survey available, only surveys
      collected between 3 and 7 years before the most recent survey are considered.
      The final year refers to the most recent survey available between 2011 and 2015.  Growth
      rates for Iraq are based on survey means of 2005 PPP$. The coverage and quality
      of the 2011 PPP price data for Iraq and most other North African and Middle
      Eastern countries were hindered by the exceptional period of instability they
      faced at the time of the 2011 exercise of the International Comparison Program.

    - The growth rate in the welfare aggregate of the bottom 40% is computed as the
      annualized average growth rate in per capita real consumption or income of the
      bottom 40% of the population in  the income distribution in a country from household
      surveys over a roughly 5-year period. Mean per capita real consumption or income
      is measured at 2011 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) using the PovcalNet (http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet).
      For some countries means are not reported due to grouped and/or confidential
      data. The annualized growth rate is computed as (Mean in final year/Mean in
      initial year)^(1/(Final year - Initial year)) - 1.  The reference year is the
      year in which the underlying household survey data was collected. In cases for
      which the data collection period bridged two calendar years, the first year
      in which data were collected is reported. The initial year refers to the nearest
      survey collected 5 years before the most recent survey available, only surveys
      collected between 3 and 7 years before the most recent survey are considered.
      The final year refers to the most recent survey available between 2011 and 2015.  Growth
      rates for Iraq are based on survey means of 2005 PPP$. The coverage and quality
      of the 2011 PPP price data for Iraq and most other North African and Middle
      Eastern countries were hindered by the exceptional period of instability they

      the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of
      the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries
      who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates
      of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the
      1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international
      migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation

    - GNI per capita (formerly GNP per capita) is the gross national income, converted
      to U.S. dollars using the World Bank Atlas method, divided by the midyear population.
      GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes
      (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of
      primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad.
      GNI, calculated in national currency, is usually converted to U.S. dollars at
      official exchange rates for comparisons across economies, although an alternative
      rate is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally
      large margin from the rate actually applied in international transactions. To
      smooth fluctuations in prices and exchange rates, a special Atlas method of
      conversion is used by the World Bank. This applies a conversion factor that
      averages the exchange rate for a given year and the two preceding years, adjusted
      for differences in rates of inflation between the country, and through 2000,
      the G-5 countries (France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United

      and investments in government assets. Investments in facilities are the resources
      the project company commits to invest during the contract period either in new
      facilities or in expansion and modernization of existing facilities. Investments
      in government assets are the resources the project company spends on acquiring

      Assistance (ODA) or official aid and Other Official Flows (OOF) and represent
      the total disbursements by the official sector at large to the recipient country.
      Net disbursements are gross disbursements of grants and loans minus repayments
      of principal on earlier loans. ODA consists of loans made on concessional terms
      (with a grant element of at least 25 percent, calculated at a rate of discount
      of 10 percent) and grants made to promote economic development and welfare in
      countries and territories in the DAC list of ODA recipients. Official aid refers
      to aid flows from official donors to countries and territories in part II of
      the DAC list of recipients: more advanced countries of Central and Eastern Europe,
      the countries of the former Soviet Union, and certain advanced developing countries
      and territories. Official aid is provided under terms and conditions similar
      to those for ODA. Part II of the DAC List was abolished in 2005. The collection
      of data on official aid and other resource flows to Part II countries ended
      with 2004 data. OOF are transactions by the official sector whose main objective
      is other than development-motivated, or, if development-motivated, whose grant
      element is below the 25 per cent threshold which would make them eligible to
      be recorded as ODA. The main classes of transactions included here are official

      of constantly below average precipitation. A drought can lead to losses to agriculture,
      affect inland navigation and hydropower plants, and cause a lack of drinking
      water and famine. A flood is a significant rise of water level in a stream,
      lake, reservoir or coastal region. Extreme temperature events are either cold
      waves or heat waves. A cold wave can be both a prolonged period of excessively
      cold weather and the sudden invasion of very cold air over a large area. Along
      with frost it can cause damage to agriculture, infrastructure, and property.
      A heat wave is a prolonged period of excessively hot and sometimes also humid
      weather relative to normal climate patterns of a certain region. Population
      affected is the number of people injured, left homeless or requiring immediate

      population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born
      population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another
      country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on
      foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than
      the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of
      the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries
      who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates
      of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the
      1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international
      migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation
      was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference
      years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference

      loan is the grant equivalent expressed as a percentage of the amount committed.
      It is used as a measure of the overall cost of borrowing. The grant equivalent
      of a loan is its commitment (present) value, less the discounted present value
      of its contractual debt service; conventionally, future service payments are
      discounted at 10 percent. Debt service payments are the sum of principal repayments
      and interest payments actually made in the year specified. Data are in current

    - Weighted mean applied tariff is the average of effectively applied rates weighted

      classified using the Harmonized System of trade at the six- or eight-digit level.
      Tariff line data were matched to Standard International Trade Classification
      (SITC) revision 3 codes to define commodity groups and import weights. To the
      extent possible, specific rates have been converted to their ad valorem equivalent
      rates and have been included in the calculation of weighted mean tariffs. Import
      weights were calculated using the United Nations Statistics Division's Commodity
      Trade (Comtrade) database. Effectively applied tariff rates at the six- and
      eight-digit product level are averaged for products in each commodity group.
      When the effectively applied rate is unavailable, the most favored nation rate
      is used instead. Primary products are commodities classified in SITC revision

      market as a U.S. dollar would buy in the United States. The ratio of PPP conversion
      factor to market exchange rate is the result obtained by dividing the PPP conversion
      factor by the market exchange rate. The ratio, also referred to as the national
      price level, makes it possible to compare the cost of the bundle of goods that
      make up gross domestic product (GDP) across countries. It tells how many dollars
      are needed to buy a dollar's worth of goods in the country as compared to the
