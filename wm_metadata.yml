# Attempt to unify the upper-level ontologies of UArizona Eidos and BBN Hume
# - focus on semantic distinctions other than the terminologies
#  - we don't attempt to differentiate "event" and "entities" but rather trying to put all causal factors into "causal_factor"
#  - use coarse-grained concepts "causal_factor", "entity" (where the causal factor is located, who and what artifacts are involved in a causal factor), "time", and "indicator_and_reported_property" as the top level concepts.
# - allow multiple inheritance (""UN/events/human/economic_crisis" is a child to both "economic_and_commerce" and "crisis_and_disaster"). Concepts under "intervention" and "condition" will overlap with other categories
